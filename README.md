## Recipe App

The program runs and everything in the passing grade requirements are working,
NOTICE: The error handling are far from perfect, I did not have time to finish and fix the userinputted errorhandling, Be aware that the program can crash.

For some strange reason the program will not launch if JUNIT for the automatic tests are in the Lib folder. I have not managed to solve this issue...
The automatic tests work but JUNIT canÂ´t exist in the lib folder for the main program to work.
I will include JUNIT in another folder so you can ensure that my automatic test works as intended.

## Some additional information
I have learned many things about OOP in this project. It has been a very time consuming project but really rewarding too..
